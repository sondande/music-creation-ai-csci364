Sagana's Notes:
- Using Heroku Postgres database to store music information for fitness function
- In scale_type:
    - Asked for the number of notes to incorporate pentatonic scale inclusion just in case we wanted to or to make
      things easier for us with dealing with a small amount of notes
      - Interval steps are in chromatic so C Major triad interval steps would be 1-5-8 in C major would be C-E-G.
        Staying consistent so that when we know our starting key, we just add the values such as for D major 3-7-10 is
        adding 2 from our C major triad. Just reference C major/minor scale, ask for user's input key, and do the proper
        arithmetic to create the scale for use
- Added starting basic data so we can start using and testing the program. Everything is saved on in the heroku database

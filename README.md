# Music Creation CSCI364

Summary:

When creating music, we have all searched for the best ideas and the best tools
to aid us in our compositions. We tend to loop up the best music production software, tutorials
on composition, mentors, and overall resources to help us grow. The initial energy to start
something is typically larger than the energy to perform a task. This is applicable to music
composition. We wanted to address this to aid those beginning music composition to take in
a variety of inputs that will be used to help generate a melody based on the inputs given. We
want to use our own knowledge, alongside using the fundamentals over certain genres of music
to help us create melodies based on a specific genre theme, personal preferences (gained through
a learning heuristic to help the computer take in considerations from other genres to allow it
to stray away from the “defined characteristic” of a specific genre), length of melody, technical
difficulty, and desired chord progression to use as a base reference.

Output:

Returns outputs of array with scale chromatic values that can be used as a reference in Ableton
